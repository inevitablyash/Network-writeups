# ICMP, GRE, and IPSec

## ICMP — Internet Control Message Protocol
- Layer 3 protocol  
- Does not use TCP or UDP  
- Used for:
  - Error reporting  
  - Diagnostics  
  - Ping and traceroute  

---

## GRE — Generic Routing Encapsulation
- Tunneling protocol  
- Transfers packets between networks  
- Does not provide encryption  

---

## IPSec — Internet Protocol Security
- Secures IP communication  
- Provides:
  - Authentication  
  - Encryption  
  - Integrity  

---

## IKE — Internet Key Exchange
Used before IPSec communication starts.

### Functions
- Negotiates encryption methods  
- Authenticates devices  
- Creates secure keys  

### Phases
- **Phase 1:** Establish secure connection  
- **Phase 2:** Create secure IPSec tunnel  

---

## AH — Authentication Header
- Provides authentication and integrity  
- No encryption  

---

## ESP — Encapsulating Security Payload
- Provides:
  - Encryption  
  - Authentication  
  - Integrity
